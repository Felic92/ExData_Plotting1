## Introduction

This is the first project in the Exploratory Data Analysis class on Coursera.
It contains 4 png files corresponding to plots and 4 R scripts to generate
the corresponding plots

## Directions

* To generate the plots you must have downloaded and extracted the Election power consumption data set this an be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

* Next you should create a directory called "Data" (without the quotes) and ensure the dataset you just downloaded is saved in this directiony. If this is not the case the script will not be able to properly generate the plots.

* Now in an active R session be sure your working directory is where the scripts and data are saved. Use source [ For example: source("plot1.R") ] to execute each script.
